 This file describes the changes made to the SquidGuard Webmin Module.
 (Version history).


 Changes
 ==============================================================================
 10.06.2001  - First beta release on June 10th 2001
 (0.85.1)
 18.06.2001  - Created Changes file tooo late
 (0.86.1)    - Oh wow, I forgot all the calls to the delete for sections,
               adding them
             - del_section.cgi is not a good choice. Splitted it up to the
               del_*.cgi files. One for each section, makes it much easier
               and the code clearer! Also it interacts better with the
               blacklist code
             - Added Support for maintenance and import of blacklist.
               import is still to be written. Maintenance works pretty good.
               Now my mom calls for dinner :-)
             - The output in edit_destgroup (domains and urls) is now sorted
             - Binary can now be configured in the module configuration
             - After a change "squidGuard -C file" is called automatically
               to rebuild the database files. This allows runtime configuration
               of SquidGuard tables.
 21.06.2001  - added del_rewgroup and disable blacklist
             - added * enabled/disabled indicator in list_blacklists
             - added stats display (enabled/disabled) in edit_blacklist
             - added disable_blacklist
             - re-added search possibility to edit_blacklist will not be
               deleted.
             - Updated the CHANGES file ;-)
             - removed del_section
             - Will push it put now
 18.10.2001  - Added german translation, thanks to Ch. Radau for this!
 (0.88.1)    - Fixed bug that cause config to be corrupted when default ACL
               was saved
             - Added Support for user statement in sourcegroups
             - Added support for userlists in sourcegroups
 22.10.2001  - Added Support for SQL databases that are available through DBI
               for user lists. Enter the information needed in the module
               configuration (example: DBI:mysql:userdb, user, passwd,
               "SELECT username FROM users") and you will get a drop down list
               for users you add to your source group.
               Requested by Sponsor wesolv'IT, Aachen
 05.11.2001  - Added SQL SELECT support for userlist additions
             - Incorporated patch by Alexandre Mathieu, this includes:
               Rebuild blacklist dbs. Reload squid by sending HUP signal on
               db rebuild
             - fixed back link in index.cgi
             - Fixating for new release
 02.11.2001  - 1st Advent :-)
             - Fixed bug in save_sourcehost. Thanx to Ladislav Bárta
             - Annoying bug in enable_blacklist fixed. Thanks to various
               reporters.
             - Fix wrong return URL in edit_sourceuserlist, thanks again to
               Ladislav Bárta
             - Fixed edit_bldomain cosmetics. Buttons must not always be
               displayed. Thanks to Hajo Möller.
             - More by Hajo Möller: Fixed eai_title in de lang, fixed
               icons in list_sourcegroups.
             - Fix wrong ACL in del_statement for timespace. Thanks to
               Ben Humphrey for this one.
             - Fix footer call in edit_sourceuser. Thanks to Ben Humphrey.
             - Fixed icon.blacklist.gif. Resized the layer to image size to
               get the image centered. Me
             - Removed push() lines. I made that in a new loop in last
               version and forgot to remove old Code. Reported by Ben Humphrey.
               Also fix the loop to do what it is expected to do :-)
             - Added french translation, thanks to Alexandre Mathieu
             - Fixed bug in edit_bldomain. form field index was unset in
               some cases or misset
 14.12.2001  - Change UID/GID of files used by SquidGuard to the ones of Squid
               (to be set in module configuration). This fixes a bug that
               caused SquidGuard processes to die since they are started as
               the squid user and not as root, which webmin normally runs as
             - Unlink .db files also if they exist and list files are
               deleted.
             - Chown downloaded blacklists
               
             


 To do
 ==============================================================================
 - keep blacklist.local, a diff with local changes to the blacklist so that
   they won't get erased after downloading new blacklists. Suggested by
   Ryan Kather.
 - Extra logging option
 - Apply changes button
